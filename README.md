# Feed-Forward Neural Network Implementation

Details regarding the mathematical theory behind the neural net implemented in this project can be viewed in the PDF file '*tfg_neural_network.pdf*'.

The design philosophy behind the implementation is based on the design used in the package *Keras* but the backpropagation algorithm and several other key elements are modified according to the notation and principles explained in the file '*tfg_neural_network.pdf*'. 

The project has been developed using only the Python language.
